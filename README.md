# CssControlBoard process

## Introduction

# ðŸ¤Ž Week 1

## Assignment choice
For this assignment we had to choose from three options: 1 creating a control board website(or something that is controlled with buttons), 2 implementing a film timeline into a interactive website or 3 the interaction of a rubiks cube in a website. I choose the first as it spoke to me the most, because I can come up with many different concepts for this and because I hope it will help me better my CSS and interaction skills. For the concept of this assigment I came up with multiple idea's of controlling of manipulating things:

* Type manipulator
* Image manipulator
* Some sort of customiser
* Lamps
* Record player
* Walkmann
* Flipable calendar

First I was very excited with my type manipulator idea, but it seemed like a hard concept to actually realise. I then choose to develop my lamp idea, of the ability to control a cute lamp and its properties such as light colour, warmth, intensity and effect. 

## Moodboard

## CSS techniques

I expect to use the following CSS techniques for these reasons:
* Grid/flexbox for creating a proper lay-out
* `:has()` attribute to create 'if statements' with CSS and change website based in input

## Challenges
I think the biggest challenge lies in creating a visually realistic lamp with light effect in code.
